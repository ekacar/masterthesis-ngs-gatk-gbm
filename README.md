##Spatial Heterogeneity in Glioblastoma

Glioblastoma (GBM), the most prevalent malignant primary brain tumor in adults, shows
a notable intratumor heterogeneity. Despite advancements in treatment, the diverse
patient responses underscore the variances within tumor tissues and across patients.
An important determinant, intratumor heterogeneity stems from somatic modifications
including small somatic mutations and copy number changes. The multi-region, bulk
whole-exome sequencing data of GBM tumor samples mirror a cellular amalgam,
wherein the count of distinct cell populations (including clones and subclones) and their
proportional ratios remain elusive. In this thesis, we used the gold standard somatic
and copy number variant calling protocols from the Broad Institute. This was followed
by the application of PhyloWGS to evaluate tumor phylogenies employing variant allele
frequency estimations. Among the identified driver genes, namely RPS3A, BRCA2,
NCOR2, CDK12, PTEN, MYEOV, KMT2D, TP53, SETBP1, and KMT2C, the distribution
exhibited discrepancies across nine subsamples derived from distinct tumor specimens
of three patients. Concurrently, the analysis of copy number alterations showed
significant gains in chromosome 7 and deletions in chromosome 10, aligning with
established knowledge in the scientific literature. Constructing phylogenetic trees based
on these mutations yielded profound insights into the spatial tumor heterogeneity
embedded within GBM.
